Description: Use multiple factor analysis to calculate individualized pathway-centric 
        scores of deviation with respect to the sampled population based on multi-omic 
        assays (e.g., RNA-seq, copy number alterations, methylation, etc). Graphical 
        and numerical outputs are provided to identify highly aberrant individuals 
        for a particular pathway of interest, as well as the gene and omics drivers of 
        aberrant multi-omic profiles.
