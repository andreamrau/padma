Description: 
  Use multiple factor analysis to calculate individualized pathway-centric 
  scores of deviation with respect to the sampled population based on multi-omic 
  assays (e.g., RNA-seq, copy number alterations, methylation, etc). Graphical 
  and numerical outputs are provided to identify highly aberrant individuals 
  for a particular pathway of interest, as well as the gene and omics drivers of 
  aberrant multi-omic profiles.
