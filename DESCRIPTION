Title: Individualized Multi-Omic Pathway Deviation Scores Using Multiple Factor Analysis
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Andrea Rau 
Maintainer: Andrea Rau <andrea.rau@inra.fr>
Description: Use multiple factor analysis to calculate individualized pathway-centric scores of deviation with respect to the sampled population based on multi-omic assays (e.g., RNA-seq, copy number alterations, methylation, etc). Graphical and numerical outputs are provided to identify highly aberrant individuals for a particular pathway of interest, as well as the gene and omics drivers of aberrant multi-omic profiles.
